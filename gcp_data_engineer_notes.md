## Introduction

Why use a cloud solution:
- traditional: maintainence cost is high, low capital investment.
- immediate deployment of the infrastructure 
- cost saving for hiring people.
> easier to setup, shorted setup time, no capitial cost, pay as go

> Notice some sensitive or critical data can not be stored in the cloud.


Why GCP
- Performance 
> network bandwidth, the individual virtual machines and the cloud are generally much faster than other cloud solutions, killer product: bigquery
- Pricing
> flexible sub-hour billing (charged by minute)
> sustained use discounts
> custom machine types(compute engine)
- Power solutions 
- Other benefits of choice
> opensource (tensorflow)  
> robust infrastructure
> environmental responsibility

Paas
> Paltform as a service, delpoy sorce code on the platform service for your application to work. 
> Managed services/No-ops and auto-scaling/serverless.
> Eg. Only need to focus on source code.
- very difficult to implement custom features.
Iaas
> Infrastructure as a service, computer nodes/vietual machine, need to maintain for your application to work.
> Eg. website: frontend, backend, load balancer and auto scaling
